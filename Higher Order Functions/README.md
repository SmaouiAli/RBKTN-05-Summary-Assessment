## [High-Order-Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function)

**cohort05-22** students went to the League of Legends world championship tournament.
using the high order functions you know (each, filter, map, and reduce)
write functions that answer the following questions that were asked to them:

- [ ] who's the oldest person in the group?
- [ ] who's good enough to participate (level 29 minimum)?
- [ ] what are the main champions of everyone in the group?
- [ ] what's the total of their points (each rank has its own points)?(DiamondPoints=10,MasterPoints=20,ChallengerPoints=30)

### _P.S_ ⚠️⚠️⚠️ : you can only use one of the high order functions once.
 Means that if you use filter in the first function you can not use it in the next function ! just use another higher order function.

```javascript
var cohort3 = [
  {
    name: "Haythem",
    age: 10,
    rank: "Master",
    level:29,
    champion:"kha'Zix"
  },
  {
    name: "Rayyen",
    age: 9,
    rank: "Diamond",
    level:28,
    champion:"Vex"
  },
  {
    name: "Sameh",
    age: 10,
    rank: "Master",
    level:29,
    champion:"Sett"
  },
  {
    name: "Oussema",
    age: 11,
    rank: "Challenger",
    level:30,
    champion:"Ashe"
  },
];
```
